# DisasterTweets-Topic-Modelling

This repository focuses on creating a Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA) Model for topic modelling to extract disaster related topics from the tweets data. In this notebook, we will also be finding the optimal number of topics for this dataset 

Dataset : This dataset contains 10,000 tweets retrieved with a variety of searches like “ablaze”, “quarantine”, and “pandemonium”, then noted whether the tweet referred to a disaster event (as opposed to a joke with the word or a movie review or something non-disastrous).
